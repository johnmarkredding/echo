# echo
Hear echoes from people who have just been where you are.

The vision is that youâ€™re walking around the park, or sitting in a traffic jam, and you can see what others were up to nearby.

Maybe you see the reason for the jam, or know to avoid some corner of the park due to a person trying to sleep.

As soon as you leave that area the echoes fall silent, and disappear from your feed.
